<h1>Best TV Shows of All Time According to Maryam</h1>
<h2>these are top 4 fave TV shows </h2>
<hr>
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>they literally spent Â£1 million on each episode. and the red wedding! the battle of bastards omg! when that bastard ramsay died</p>
<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>absolutely loved it; reminds me of gcse and a-level chemistry days. walter white is the smartest man alive; argue with yourself; loved jesse too RIP :(</p>
<h3>La Casa de Papel</h3>
<p>do i need to even explain why! so addictive and literally made me wanna start learning spanish hehe. also i lied, el professor is the smartest man alive </p>
<h3>Narcos</h3>
another spanish banger, i only watched season 1 though, after pablo died it all felt a bit pointless to carry on with the show tbh
